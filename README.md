# Calorie Banking

Distribute your weekly calories by using a slider to increase or decrease the calories from a day, and it will automatically adjust the other days of the week.
Features

## Features 

**Automatically calculates your daily calorie needs and macronutrient breakdown if you don't know them already.**

**Customizable Protein Intake:**

Choose how many grams of protein you want per unit of bodyweight.

**Flexible Carb and Fat Distribution:**

Split the remaining calories between carbohydrates and fats according to your preference.

**Dynamic Calorie Adjustment:**

When you increase or decrease the calories for a specific day, it maintains the protein amount (as this is based on your bodyweight) and adjusts carbs and fats accordingly.

**Day Locking:**

Ability to 'lock' a specific day so that adjustments to other days don't affect the locked day.

## Usage

Enter your personal details (age, gender, weight, height, activity level) to calculate your base calorie needs.

Set your desired protein intake per unit of bodyweight.

Adjust the carb/fat ratio for your remaining calories.

Use the sliders to redistribute calories across your week as desired.

Lock any days you don't want to be affected by further adjustments.

## Note
The calorie calculation currently works only with the metric system.
